# Number Guessing Game

## Project Description
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The player is prompted to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the `number_guessing_game.py` file.
3. Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

## How to Play
1. The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
3. The game will provide feedback indicating whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
5. If you guess the correct number or run out of attempts, the game will end and offer you the option to play again.

## Additional Features
- Input validation to ensure only valid numbers are entered.
- Option to play again after the game ends.

## Dependencies
- `tkinter`: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It comes pre-installed with Python.
